# Part 2: Design for Scalability

This section outlines essential considerations for scaling the URL collection and analysis process effectively. Our goal is to build a system that can handle the collection and analysis of millions of URLs efficiently.

## URL Collection

- **Seed URLs**: Begin with a curated list of relevant websites that represent your domain of interest. This initial set of URLs will serve as the starting point for further crawling.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Systematically discover new URLs from visited pages using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` to parse links.
- **URL Queuing and Visited URL Tracking**: Maintain a queue (list) of discovered URLs and a set/dictionary of visited URLs to efficiently manage new and previously visited pages, thus avoiding redundant processing.

## Scalability Strategies

- **Parallelization** (Optional): For large-scale operations, distribute crawling tasks across multiple threads or processes. Libraries like `Scrapy` are well-suited for this purpose and can dramatically increase the processing speed.
- **Data Storage**: Efficiently store collected URLs and extracted topics. Depending on the scale, use a scalable database solution like PostgreSQL, or for simpler setups, flat files such as CSV might suffice.

## Reliability

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust mechanisms to handle potential issues such as website errors, network interruptions, and parsing exceptions gracefully.
- **Monitoring**: Utilize logging tools to keep track of crawling progress, resource usage, and any encountered errors. This will aid in maintaining operational stability and allow for quick troubleshooting.
